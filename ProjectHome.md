This project contains set of php 5 classes for development of custom gdata like custom REST servers based on HTTP and XML - ATOM.

Idea is to create custom extension based on this framework to develop custom REST API for a custom webservice. I'll tend to provide sample extensions for well known php web applications.

Inspiration is definitively google set of apis based on gdata format and protocol. There are many client libraries to use these apis. On the other hand, currently there are no classes (at least not for php) which could be helpful to achieve similar goal and develop custom gdata/atom server.

MVC frameworks were also in mind although View component is quite different than what you have with cake, codeigniter and similar.
